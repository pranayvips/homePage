## Intro
I developed a visually enhanced and highly customizable home page for the browser's new tab, aiming to improve user experience and productivity. This project integrated several key features, including a to-do list manager that enables users to efficiently organize and track their tasks directly from their browser tab. Additionally, I incorporated various settings that allow users to personalize their browsing environment, ensuring a seamless and productive workflow.
To further enhance the functionality of the home page, I implemented real-time weather updates using the OpenWeatherMap API, which provides weather data for over 200,000 cities worldwide. This feature ensures that users can stay informed about current weather conditions without needing to visit external websites. By integrating these features into a single, streamlined interface, the home page not only improves convenience but also enhances the overall browsing experience, making it more engaging and efficient for users.
